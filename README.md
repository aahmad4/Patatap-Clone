# Patatap Clone
A clone of the Patatap website, recreated with Paper.js. I created this project for fun in my spare time to learn Paper.js, and make a nice project in the mean time. The website is very functional and easy to use. I've hosted it on netlify and you can view it [here](https://paperjspatatap.netlify.app/) or down below.

## How It Works
The concept of the website is fairly straightforward. It follows a lot of the same concepts in the original Patatap website. Each key you hit holds a specific shape, color, and sound value. Also, each key holds a specific animation and effect. You can hit as many keys as you want and there will be different effects, visuals, and soudns played on each tap. It's a fun project that I encourage you to dabble around with.
